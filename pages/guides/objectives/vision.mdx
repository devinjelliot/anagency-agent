# Vision
The vision behind Backpack is to create a future where the concept of money is transformed into an instant and ephemeral experience, enabling a post-scarcity economy reminiscent of the world depicted in Star Trek. In this future, all values are relative, and the focus shifts to ensuring that individuals contribute their best value to the world and are rewarded accordingly.

## Star Trek Inspiration
During the ICO craze in 2016, the idea of a future where everything has its own token sparked the realization that such a system could enable nearly instant and ephemeral experiences with money. While it's challenging for humans to mentally compute the exchange of value across a vast number of relative values, computers and algorithms excel in this domain. The vision of an infinite token future serves as the foundation for a post-scarcity economy, where the relative value of desired actions takes precedence. The ultimate goal is to create a system capable of computing the relative value of everything, facilitating a world where individuals are rewarded based on their contributions.

## Transition from the Blockbuster Era of Money
The current monetary system has been a remarkable invention that has served us well for centuries. However, it's now time to improve and revolutionize it. The speed at which money moves across networks should match the pace at which value is streamed across other familiar networks.

Here are key considerations regarding the speed of money and its impact on value creation:

- Slow money incurs costs in terms of time and value.
- The speed of money directly correlates with the potential value that can be generated.
- Comparing the shift from Blockbuster (traditional video rental) to streaming platforms, we observe that streaming content increased the value of all content. Similarly, streaming money has the potential to increase the overall value created.
- Value can be expressed as the product of time and money.
- Faster money movement enables the creation of more value.
- Increased value creation allows for capturing more value.
- Sharing value in turn stimulates further value creation.
- This creates a self-reinforcing value cycle, similar to the Krebs cycle, where the more energy we generate, the more energy we can generate.

Through Backpack, we aim to build a financial ecosystem that aligns with this vision, enabling seamless, instant, and value-driven experiences with money. By leveraging innovative technologies and reimagining the possibilities, we can shape a future where the exchange and flow of value are optimized, empowering individuals to contribute their best value and thrive in a post-scarcity economy.
