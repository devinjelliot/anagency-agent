# User Experience and Polybase Architecture

## Data Workflow and User Experience

From the user's perspective, data in RecordsSide is structured as data workflows that the user transitions through to create a data record. These workflows facilitate the seamless creation of data records within the RecordsSide platform.

## Polybase Architecture

### What is the Polybase architecture?

Polybase is a state zk-rollup protocol that offers native support for pluggable data storage and indexing. Despite its complex appearance, our Software Development Kit (SDK) handles all the necessary components out of the box, providing a Firebase-like API for developers.

For more detailed information about our architecture, please refer to our [Polybase Whitepaper](https://polybase.xyz/whitepaper).

### Storage Options in Polybase

- Local storage / custodial: This option allows users to store data on their devices, making it ideal for highly private data and self-custodian use cases.

- Decentralized storage protocols: Polybase supports various decentralized storage protocols such as Filecoin, IPFS, Arweave, and others.

- Centralized storage: Options like AWS S3, Postgres, Google BigTable, and similar centralized stores can be utilized. However, it's important to note that choosing a centralized storage option may expose your data to government censorship risks.

By default, the SDK implementation in Polybase employs the Polybase datastore, which is a decentralized datastore with functionality similar to Firebase Firestore.

### Is Polybase Centralized if Data is Stored Off-chain?

No, Polybase remains decentralized despite storing data off-chain.

Our core innovation lies in validating data on-chain using merkle tree root hashes and zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs). This approach enables the security benefits of a blockchain while maintaining the cost and scalability advantages of a web2 database.

For a more comprehensive understanding of this methodology, please refer to the [Polybase Whitepaper](https://polybase.xyz/whitepaper).

- Local storage / custodial: Only the user can access and view the data as it remains private.

- Decentralized storage protocol: The data is public, but encryption can be implemented to ensure that only valid users can decrypt and read it.

- Centralized storage: Custom access controls can be implemented to regulate data access.

Regardless of the storage option chosen, data can be encrypted for enhanced privacy protection. The Polybase SDKs offer functionality to encrypt data using a wallet, such as a user's Metamask wallet or a custodial wallet for the dApp.

### Signing Transactions and Write Permissions

Currently, every write/update transaction on Polybase needs to be signed. In a non-custodial implementation, the transaction is typically signed by the user's wallet. We are actively working on simplifying the process of creating a "session key," which will be a symmetric key encrypted using the user's wallet. Utilities to facilitate the creation of a session key will be added to the SDK.

Writes to a Polybase collection are performed by calling a function defined in the collection's schema. All updates must occur via these collection functions; there is no general `.set()` function available.

### Read Permissions and Polybase

Polybase offers two ways to define read permissions:

1. Encrypting data using encryption utilities: This approach enables control over who can read the data by sharing a secret key with authorized users.

2. Adding permission/authorization rules: Read and delegate directives, such as `@read` and `@delegate`, can be applied to define rules on the schema. These directives allow fine-grained control over who can query records.
