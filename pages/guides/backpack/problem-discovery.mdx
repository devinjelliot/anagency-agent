# Fintech Data Models

We're building a new type of crypto wallet. Each of the following data models will need to be included into specific functions where each function is a to a user just another way to specifically work with money. The UX needs to accommodate a potentially large number similar seeming functions. The design challenge is therefore to manage this nuanced complexity in such a way for the user to find the experience enjoyable.

## Can you output data models?
Yes, the GPT3 can output data models that can be used to create a mobile UX. However, it is important to note that the quality of the data model will depend on the quality of the input data. If you have a limited amount of data, or if your data is of poor quality, then the data model that is produced will also suffer from poor quality.
