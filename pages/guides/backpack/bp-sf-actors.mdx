# Backpack and Storefront Actors
## Customers

Customers are individuals who make purchases with their card at a merchant's store or online.

## Merchants

Merchants are businesses that sell goods or services to customers and accept card payments as a form of payment. Merchants typically use a point-of-sale (POS) system to process card transactions, which may be a physical terminal or a software application.

## Merchant's POS System

A merchant's POS system is the hardware and software used by the merchant to process card transactions. This may include a physical terminal for swiping or inserting cards, or a software application for accepting card payments online or via mobile devices.

## Card Issuers

Card issuers are financial institutions that issue cards to customers and maintain their accounts. When a customer makes a purchase with a card, the merchant's POS system sends a request for authorization to charge the customer's account to the card issuer. If the transaction is approved, the card issuer sends a response back to the merchant's POS system to complete the transaction.

## Card Networks

Card networks are networks that connect the various parties involved in a card transaction, such as the card issuer, merchant, and acquiring bank. When a customer makes a purchase with a card, the merchant's POS system sends a request to the card network to complete the transaction. The card network routes the request to the customer's bank (the acquiring bank) to request payment, and if the transaction is approved, sends a response back to the merchant's POS system to complete the transaction.

## Acquiring Banks (Merchant Acquirers)

Acquiring banks, also known as merchant acquirers, are financial institutions that provide merchants with the ability to accept card payments from customers. When a customer makes a purchase with a card, the merchant's POS system sends a request for authorization to charge the customer's account to the acquiring bank. If the transaction is approved, the acquiring bank processes the transaction and transfers the funds from the customer's account to the merchant's account. Acquiring banks typically charge merchants a fee for their services, which may include a percentage of the transaction amount, a flat fee per transaction, or both.

## Payment Gateways

A payment gateway is a software application that connects a merchant's website or POS system to the card network, enabling the merchant to accept card payments online or in-store. Payment gateways often provide additional features such as fraud detection and prevention, as well as support for various payment methods such as credit cards, debit cards, and online payment services like PayPal.

## Payment Processors

A payment processor is a company that handles the technical aspects of processing card transactions for merchants. Payment processors typically work with merchant acquirers to provide merchants with the necessary hardware and software to accept card payments, and they may also offer additional services such as fraud prevention, chargeback protection, and technical support.

## Other Parties

There are several other parties involved in the overall card payment process, such as the customer's bank (also known as the issuing bank), the card network's clearinghouse, and various regulators and industry organizations that oversee and govern the card payment industry.
