## Executive Summary
Backpack is a groundbreaking, open-source wallet that puts you in control of your personal data and unlocks the vast potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) for everyone. The project's vision revolves around four fundamental areas: records, plugins, assets, and architecture. By building on existing open-source software (OSS) and collaborating with like-minded projects, Backpack strives to revolutionize personal finance and make DeFi accessible to all.

## Key Features
Records: Embrace Personal Data Ownership
Backpack empowers you to own, manage, and exchange your personal data privately and securely with your consent. Records, a digital representation of personal data, streamline the process of data management and allow users to trade data with participating merchants for discounts or other incentives.

Initially hosted centrally, Backpack plans to transition to a decentralized, L2, and on-chain solution in the future.

## Plugins: Simplify DeFi Access
Unlocking DeFi's potential for the average user, Backpack offers a clean and intuitive user experience that turns complex financial operations into straightforward workflows. The open-source platform encourages developers to create and customize plugins, expanding functionality and choice for end-users.
The plugin store architecture is likely to build on MerokuDAO's OSS dapp-sdk, supported by Polygon.

## Assets: Personalized Financial Management
Backpack puts you first, focusing on stablecoins for usability and reduced currency exposure. Organizing assets by financial personas (spending, saving, and investing), the platform caters to individual preferences and risk profiles. Ethereum-based assets are favored for their liquidity, access, and support.

## Architecture: Mobile-First and EIP-4337 Compliant
Designed with a mobile-first approach, Backpack emphasizes EIP-4337 standards and explores a hybrid solution involving EOAs for specific utility operations. The project is evaluating options such as Unipass and Stackup.sh to enhance user experience and functionality further.

## Collaboration and Integration: Embracing Open Source Software
Backpack's vision thrives on integration and collaboration with various OSS projects, including:

- [Farcaster](https://farcaster.xyz/)
- [Unipass](https://unipass.id/)
- [SquidRouter](https://squidrouter.com/)

## Conclusion: Empowerment and Access in the DeFi Era
Backpack heralds a new age in personal finance and DeFi accessibility, championing data ownership, simplifying user experiences, and fostering a collaborative, growing ecosystem. By securing a Gitcoin Grant OSS award, Backpack will advance its mission to democratize DeFi access and empower individuals in the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance.
