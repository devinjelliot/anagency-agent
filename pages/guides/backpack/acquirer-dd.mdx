### What are the primary use cases Checkout will be processing for?Â 

- Backpack is an on-ramp service that provides wallet users with an easy and convenient way to convert their fiat currency (USD) into USDC, a stablecoin. This enables users to participate in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments and service contracts on social networks.
- Storefront is a payment system designed for small- to medium-sized e-commerce businesses and service providers. It allows consumers to make payments in USD, while merchants can settle in USDC. This enables merchants to streamline their accounting processes, track payments, and receive USDC directly in their Backpack wallet, which is linked to their account.

### Are the credit card transactions for fiat load, direct crypto purchase, or both?

-   Backpack offers direct on-ramps for USDC purchases.

### Custodial wallet or external wallet(s)?

-   Our Backpack Wallet product offers self-custodial wallet services, allowing users to have complete control and ownership over their funds. This approach aligns with our commitment to providing secure and transparent financial management solutions.

### Does the merchant offer high yield to keep customers crypto on their platform?

-   Our platform does not provide high yield incentives to keep customers' crypto on our platform. Instead, our focus is on offering a secure and reliable platform for customers to manage and transact with stable tokens, specifically USDC. Our utility is not based on offering high yield opportunities, but rather on providing a stable and trustworthy solution for customers' crypto needs.
