## Backpack Domain Model

### Persona Wallet

- Following the initial onboarding, this is the default view when the app launches.
- Users can see their total liquid balance of the wallet.
- Users can see their persona avatar.
- Users can tap on the record room.
- Users can tap on the asset room.
- Users can tap on the plugin room.
- A user can have as many of these wallet accounts as they want.
