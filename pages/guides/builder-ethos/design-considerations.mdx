1.  **Decentralization is the goal.** Web3 projects should strive to be sufficiently decentralized, with enough distributed nodes and participants to ensure that no single entity has too much control over the system's operations.

2.  **Centralization is a stepping stone.** While centralization may be an acceptable starting point for building a system, it is typically seen as a stepping stone towards decentralization.

3.  **Balance is key.** The balance between centralization and decentralization is constantly in motion and may require ongoing adjustments as a project evolves. 

4.  **Persist data cautiously.** Persistence of data is a liability because it can make a system more vulnerable to censorship, tampering, and other forms of attack. Therefore, data should be persistent only when necessary, and only with caution.

5.  **Business logic vs. technical details.** The persistence of data can be at odds between the goals of business logic and technical details.

6.  **Governance is inclusive.** Contention between business logic and technical details likely will need votes, which can be open or gated. Gating is a quality control feature that is used to ensure that only participants who have demonstrated a certain level of knowledge or expertise are able to vote.

7.  **Value is determined by interactions.** Value is placed where exchange of it can create neutral or positive feedback loops. This means that the value of a project is determined by how well it can create positive interactions between its participants.

8.  **Quality is our key differentiator.** We believe that the quality of the products we create is our key differentiator. Our design system aims to prioritize aspects of a project that will lead to the best outcomes and ensure that quality is at the forefront.
