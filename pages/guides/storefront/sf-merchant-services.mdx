## Merchant Services
- Our customers are afforded the flexibility of making payments through credit cards, debit cards, and cryptocurrencies. This caters to a diverse range of preferences, enabling seamless transactions for all parties involved.
- We understand that each merchant's requirements are unique, which is why we offer the creation of custom checkout workflows tailored to their specific business needs. This service is currently complimentary, although the policy may be subject to future revisions.
- Our platform is equipped to support a variety of payment gateways to cater to the different needs of our merchants. This flexibility ensures that businesses can choose the gateway that best suits their operations.
- We have designed a structure where reusable gateways are available across similar verticals, promoting efficiency and ease of use. However, the checkout workflows remain unique to each business, reflecting their individual requirements.
- We are pioneering a novel approach where all transactions from debit and credit cards are processed as purchases for USDC or another USD-backed stable coin. This approach essentially functions as a fiat on-ramp.
- To support instant transaction settlement, we maintain a stock of USDC, essentially treating it as inventory. Our goal is to procure this 'inventory' in the most cost-efficient manner possible to maintain our competitive edge.
- Initially, we are setting a soft cap on daily USDC purchases at $100k to ensure a steady and manageable growth rate.
- The beauty of our system lies in its transparency: customers need not be aware of the crypto transactions happening behind the scenes. Our primary focus is to ensure transactions are processed as swiftly as possible and at the lowest cost, providing an effortless and economical experience for the customer.
- In essence, we are redefining the rules of merchant services, blending traditional financial instruments with the cutting-edge technology of cryptocurrencies to provide a service that is both efficient and cost-effective.
