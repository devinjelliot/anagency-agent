## Market Assessment and Analysis

### Sales and Marketing Plan

Our sales and marketing plan leverages the unique advantages of web3 social networks to drive viral growth and retention. We believe that these networks resemble a market vertical with domain expertise-driven collaborative networks. For example, Farcaster looks like a combination of crypto Twitter, LinkedIn, and Fiverr, with domain-specific topics, a talent network, and the ability to establish collaboration or projects.

To market to these networks, we plan to focus on regular contribution and engagement, rather than traditional dollar-based acquisition. For example, we will post about our product, Paycast, and use it to send payments to friends, which will be posted on the timeline for organic (but with an entire attribution history) interest and engagement. Engagement often comes from accounts with established social credit, such as the founder of Farcaster, liking and re-casting our product. Our sales strategy involves direct messages, Zoom calls, flow of funds discovery, proposed custom experience, KYC/KYB, build experience, and onboarding.

We believe that early partnerships providing utility that works for these networks will pay dividends on the viral factors that will contribute to the originating network protocol's velocity. By providing entry product and service offerings, we can enable users to rapidly onboard and execute a stable-to-stable in-network transaction with more simplicity than they expected. Settlement in USDC has been welcomed by many SMB merchants, and we believe that the ability to exit back to USD at any time with less than 7 days lag time, 3-day seems to be a generally acceptable sweet spot, and same-day is a no-brainer.

To retain users, we plan to build tools for web3 social networks that work like embeds, but now the embeds are tied to financial accounts. We expect that early partnerships in providing utility that works to these networks will pay dividends on the viral factors that will grow from and contribute to the originating network protocol's velocity. We believe this approach could be "sticky AF," but we recognize the risk of inauthentic participation in the community, which could lead to churn. To mitigate this risk, we plan to have dedicated teammates of the projects that are also power users of the network being serviced.

By leveraging the unique advantages of web3 social networks, we can build a sustainable business that generates long-term value for all stakeholders. Our sales and marketing plan focuses on engagement, retention, and building great products that deliver exceptional value to our customers. We believe that by staying at the forefront of web3 technology, we can establish ourselves as the leading provider of crypto payment services and own the payment infrastructure for web3.

### Competitive Advantage

- On-ramps:
    - We see the landscape existing in 4 modes, 3 of which we have management level control over: on-ramps, off-ramps, and in-network.
    - The out-network is out of our domain but holds a place in the system for tracking the concept as the barrier is not a static line but one that is dynamic as it's the derivative of other factors such as regulations, competitor offerings, costs, and consumer trends, to name a few.
    - This market has incumbents such as Stripe which are not easy or even appropriate to compete against directly. Instead, we need to focus on what they don't do well, which is seamlessly hand-off the onramp experience from the USD network to USDC networks.
    - From this position, we can focus on building out the gateway integrations all the way to implementation, which is a level of service beyond what Stripe offers in their currently dominated space and will not be an aspect of the landscape that plays to their strengths.
    
- Off-ramps:
    - This service completes the circuit through USD.
    - It provides end-to-end crypto transactional solutions.
    - It represents an additional source of revenue.
    - Most current providers of this service in this space are exchanges, making the product line itself a supporting product and not primary.
    - These fintech services aren't often provided by the same partners as the on-ramps, requiring further diversification of domain expertise to secure the product line and increasing our product defensibility through surface area of effort.
- In-network:
    - All of our UX is designed around stable-to-stable experiences, which, in user terms, means it's familiar, like a normal USD transaction.
    - On-ramps and off-ramps are at your fingertips; there's no need for users to go find the service somewhere else, which often requires a movement of funds and incurs transaction costs, reducing the friction associated with transactions within the network.
