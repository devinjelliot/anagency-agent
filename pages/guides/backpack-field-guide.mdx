# Backpack: Revolutionizing the Way You Manage Your Finances

## Introduction

In the beginning, there was money, and it was good... before that, you literally had to carry your table around if you wanted to sell in the hopes someone you ran into might also need exactly that table. That's not a good UX.

Then we created banks, and banks were also good...ish. They made it so your money could be safer than your mattress, but the costs were hidden and very different.

Today we bring you Backpack, it's a new way to do money and banking, baney or monking if you will. Extracting the great things about banks and combining that with the best parts of money to bring you a personalized version of finance unlike anything you've experienced before.

## Welcome to Backpack

When you sign up for Backpack, you'll instantly receive three wallets - Spend, Save, and Invest - each serving as a financial identity of sorts.

## Backpack: Making Financial Management Easier

Backpack is designed to make what you already do a lot of - spending, saving, investing - easier than you ever thought possible.

It's hard to conceive how slow money moves today, so an analogy here may be of value:

Before we were able to stream movies at any moment of the day, we had to go down to the corner video store and physically pick them up. Even the progressive steps we made towards streaming look archaic today - Redbox was better, and Netflix started by mailing you DVDs. Then the switch flipped, and everything was on demand.

Value is going through the same type of renaissance - you're standing at the door of a new way of interacting with value; we're about to start streaming.

Before Netflix existed, watching a movie required you to go to your local video store to pick up a physical copy and bring it home, kinda like how you used to go to a bank to pick up physical money.
