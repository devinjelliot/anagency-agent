## Sweat Capital Goals
- Functionally it's equity in a 2 step form via NFT. Token 1 is just capital as a debt instrument with a repayment maturity of 2yrs and carries a coupon of 15% per year, so 30% return to purchaser. 
- Token 2 is issued against participation as measured by an internal event driven point system, specifically for categories: Support, Testing, Delivering 
- For the points just think POAPs but without all the fan fair. The design is to put points where incredible value for a project can be created but often is difficult because people pushed to uncomfortable places they tend to avoid, tedium, public speaking/presenting, troubleshooting, etc. 
- Token 1 is a member key to the dao and holders of this key have access to participation opportunities provided by builders (holders of token 2). It's not a requirement to participate but if they want more upside beyond their interest payments then they must earn it with some labor like the rest of us. 
- Token 2 has access to the most value as measured by profit, which is defined as new revenue generated beyond the cost of operations. Cost of healthy ops which is defined as current monthly costs *24 i.e. you need to have 24 months of runway saved up, then the org is healthy, then all money beyond that is revenue shared out to Token 2 holders
- The goal is to solve for the negative feedback loops we've witnessed and experienced repeatedly from VC money, and where possible flip those loops to positive cases.
