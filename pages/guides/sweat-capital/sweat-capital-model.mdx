# Sweat Capital Model
Sweat Capital is an alternative to venture capital. Where venture capital focuses on creating as much value as possible and exiting with as much of it as possible by selling out their positions, Sweat Capital focuses on creating as much value as possible in a sustainable and ongoing way. No exit, no sale of value, just profits.

# The Model

## Goals
Too often, we see companies prioritizing speed and growth above all else, sacrificing quality and sustainability in the process. We believe that building durable organizations and rewarding efficiency is the key to long-term success. Our goal is to support teams that are committed to creating value in a sustainable and ongoing way, rather than just chasing short-term gains. By focusing on quality and efficiency, we aim to create businesses that are built to last and can stand the test of time.

## Funding 
Sweat Capital begins with a debt instrument in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT). These debts are structured like bonds, with a fixed term, maturity date, and coupon rate. Startups can pay back the capital at maturity, typically at an above-market rate due to the higher risk profile of early-stage companies. This NFT structure allows for flexibility in repayment terms and the ability to track and monitor the progress of the startup. By providing funding through a debt instrument, Sweat Capital is able to align the interests of the startup and the investor, as both parties have a vested interest in the success of the company without being married yet.

## Value Creation
We believe in playing the "infinite game" of building long-term, sustainable businesses rather than the "finite game" of chasing short-term gains. By focusing on the long-term success of our startups, we can help them build businesses that are built to last.

- Profit sharing: We believe in aligning the interests of our startups and our investors, which is why we offer profit sharing as part of our investment structure. This allows everyone to share in the success of the company and incentivizes everyone to work towards long-term profitability.
    
-   Lean teams: By supporting lean, efficient teams, we can help startups reduce costs and increase profitability. We believe that a small, agile team can often be more effective than a large, cumbersome one, and we offer resources and support to help startups build and maintain lean teams.
    
-   No fantasy private market valuation hurdles: Unlike some investment models that rely on inflated private market valuations, we focus on helping startups achieve real, sustainable profits. This means that our startups don't need to worry about unrealistic valuation hurdles or unrealistic growth expectations.

## Exits
One of the key differences between our model and traditional venture capital is our approach to exits. In the traditional model, a startup must sell for more than the last round of funding in order to have a successful exit. However, this can be difficult to achieve due to the inflated valuations often seen in the private market and the fact that a company can only be sold once.

On the other hand, our model focuses on generating ongoing profits rather than seeking a single exit event. We believe that profits can be repeated many times and are an important goal for any business. Instead of exiting a company, we offer profit sharing as a way to create value for all stakeholders. This aligns the interests of the startup, the investor, and any other parties involved, and allows everyone to share in the success of the company over the long term.

## Value Alignment
The Sweat Capital model was created with the idea of teamwork in mind. We looked to team sports as our inspiration and reevaluated rewards and incentives to create a system that would benefit everyone involved. With this model, we trade exits for recurring profits, excessive spending for efficient teams, and quantity for quality. We believe that this will make all parties far more money than if they left it up to chance with venture capital.
